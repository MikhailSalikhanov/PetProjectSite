# PetProjectSite

PET(!) project as it should be ;)

Responsive design:
  > up to 399 px;
  > 400-768 px;
  > 768-9999px (It is not a joke. Just try to set width 9999px!)

Used stack and tools:
  > HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass
  > Git, Figma, Photoshop 

Ð¡ompletely my work (not including design). It is not "copy-paste project" from courses or "don`t-think-and-repeat project" from Youtube.
I'm sure it is not perfect. But it is mine :)
